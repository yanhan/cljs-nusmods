Module addition via URL hash on initialization
- On going through the entire url hash, if we encounter a module whose
  lesson types / lesson groups are all non existent, should we go on to add the
  module? I'd say yes
- Mutate `document.location.hash` to a canonical representation after
  initialization

- timetable.cljs
  -> Create functions for retrieving <td> elements and similar. Replace the
     code in `add-module-lesson` and `shift-lesson-to-row`
  -> Handle modules with lessons on Saturday, such as CN2108
  -> Handle modules whose lesson time begins before 0800, such as MNO4319
     (NUSMods does not show such lessons, cors.bicrement.com does)
  -> Refactor code!

document.location.hash
- Handle modules without _any_ lessons, such as CS1231R

Select2 box
- Focus remains in the input box after selecting a module. This should not
  be the case.
- Disable use of backspace key to remove modules
- Let each module occupy 1 line. Currently everything is cluttered together
