# cljs-nusmods

ClojureScript implementation of [NUSMods](http://nusmods.com)

**NOTE:** Currently this project does nothing. But soon it will do something.

**NOTE:** This is purely a personal project done for the sake of challenging
myself, since it's something I have wanted to do for quite some time.
Recently I've wanted to learn some ClojureScript, and what better way to dive
into it with an actual project?

For actual usage, I strongly recommend you use [NUSMods](http://nusmods.com).
It is less buggy and contains a lot more features.
